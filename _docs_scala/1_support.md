title: "What type of Scala projects does Snyk support?"
---
Snyk supports testing and fixing Scala projects that have their dependencies managed by [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/). Support is available for GitHub repositories, and via the Snyk [CLI](/docs/using-snyk/).

**Note: To use the Snyk CLI, you will need to first install the [sbt-dependency-graph plugin](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph).**
