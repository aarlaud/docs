title: "Bitbucket Server set-up"

In order to interact with your Bitbucket Server repositories, Snyk needs to use the credentials of a Bitbucket user. The username and password must be provided to the broker client, which then identifies with these credentials on requests as they are proxied from Snyk to your Bitbucket Server deployment.

*The Bitbucket Server credentials never leave your network!*
