title: Adding Cloud Foundry Apps to Snyk
---
Once you've successfully connected Snyk to your Cloud Foundry account, you'll be able to select Cloud Foundry apps that you would like Snyk to monitor. You can do this either using the "Add projects" button on the integrations page, or directly from the Cloud Foundry integration settings page.

In either case, you'll see a list of any available projects on the Cloud Foundry account you connected. Select the ones you want to monitor and click the "add to Snyk" button.

As soon as you've added the projects to Snyk, Snyk will test them and begin to display a list of all monitored Cloud Foundry applications in your [project dashbard](https://snyk.io/projects). You'll also see a snapshot of any current vulnerabilities, and be able to click through for a more detailed report including any steps to remediate.

Snyk will now continuously monitor each of those projects for known vulnerabilities. You can add more projects at any time.
